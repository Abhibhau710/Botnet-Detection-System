# Botnet-Detection-System
Botnet comprises 80% of the attacks on the internet in the modern world. These nefarious activities are well organized and carried out by a hacker. A botnet is a network of malware compromised computers (called as bot or zombie) under the control of a hacker (also called as botherder or bot-master). A botherder controls the bots by using a Command and Control server (C&C). Identifying the vulnerable systems, propagating the malware, sending the command, and code updates and carrying out the attack are primarily controlled by the C&C server. A collective effort from the botnet attacks can result in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), phishing, spamming, spreading of malware, information theft, unwanted ads, generating virtual clicks and cryptocurrency mining.Botnets are generally categorized according to the protocol used by the command-and-control server in IRC, HTTP, DNS or Peer to Peer (P2P) botnets. Botnets can be detected using various algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, KNN, K-nearest neighbor, na√Øve bayes, support vector machine, etc.
